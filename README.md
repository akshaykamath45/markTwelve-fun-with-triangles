<i>Hey everyone,This is Akshay Kamath,Computer Engineering Student at DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering,Mumbai.</i>

<b>This is a app built in Vanilla JS.There are 4 pages linked to it,You can check from the angle,if it is a triangle or not.You can calculate the area and hypotenuse of the triangle,Also there is a quiz based on it.
</b>

## Problem Statement:
1. Ask the user to input three angles and you say whether the angles make a triangle or not.
2. Prepare a Quiz and enable the user to play the quiz and calculate scores based on the answers chosen by the user.
3. Calculate hypotenuse of a triangle given the other two sides
4. Calculate area of a triangle given the base and height of a triangle
